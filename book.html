		<p>With this handbook you may become a millionaire, by owning a set of private keys and/or cryptographic seed.</p>

		<p> The message to the reader: </p>
			<p><img src="images/etc/proem_m.png" class="center"/></p>
		<p>	The message above is "digitally signed" using the private key of the address below. The so-called private key
			is just a sequence of alphanumeric symbols:
			<p><code>Kzk1sp2YTVADSi5ZXqc978eFcjaaG8mxc5dJ71b1rzQRbewkn7dt</code><p>
			<br />The so-called address is a sequence of alphanumeric symbols as well, but shorter.
 			<br /><b>1EXAMp1EiEzUkEKBsdq3SJ9y3DoyDAEWhk</b>
			<br />Technically speaking, the address is a public form of a private key, which means
			that public key (address) is "mathematically crafted" by some computing oompa-loompa involving a private key
			- kinda Enigma nowadays, but completely digital. </p>
		<p>	A private key can be used to sign any kind of information - transactional messages about the balance change
			on the corresponding address (public key), or even arbitrary data like text or image. </p>
			<p><img src="images/etc/proem_a.png" class="center"/></p>
		<p> In our example we made a non-fungible token (character sequence) out of meaningful citation, by hashing it
			into characters according to a formula that includes the keys provided. This token can be checked using
			buzzy wallet software like the BlueWallet or Electrum (at the time of writing):</p>

			<i>Newlines should be ignored in the digital signature (token) above. Perceive it as a single string.</i>

		<p>Joe took his favourite book, opened the page with table of contents. Hi was sure he has a good idea.
		He wrote down words on a piece of paper. "Exciting!", he tought. Count of the words exactly matched his needs.
		</p>

		<p>
			<table class="center">
			  <tr>
				<td>Code</td>
				<td>Units</td>
				<td>Pocket</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>Game</td>
				<td>Rules</td>
				<td>Redhead</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>Nemesis</td>
				<td>Poison</td>
				<td>Thunderstorm</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>Care</td>
				<td>Solstice</td>
				<td>Universe</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
		</p>

		<p>The words he wrote are called "seed phrase". A seed from which trees grow.
		</p>

		<h1 id="ch2" class="chapter">Units</h1>

		<p>Yet another morning started. Jacob, the barista at the local coffee shop was full of energy.
		Georgeous, magnificent young lady ordered a latte. "These girls are so beautiful in so many different ways,
			but at the same time so similar" - flashed through his mind</p>

		<p><i>"How much for a latte?"</i>, girl asked
		<br /><i>"Five sixty, please"</i>, Jacob smiled, as usual
		</p>

		<p>For some reason, his attention sticked to the numbers in a bill. Once he read that in a single coffee cup
		there are around 56 coffee beans. The packages of coffee beans he had in a bar were weighted 8.8oz. For some reason,
			packaging had imperial system of measurement on it - ounces. It seems that ounces et cetera units,
			invented for convenience, do not, however, reflect the exact and real state of affairs.</p>

		<p>In the evening after shift, Jacob, looking at his wallet with virtual money,
			switched the units from convenient to precise. </p>

		<p>"Coffee beans... at least they're genuine" - with this thought he fell asleep
			on the sofa without even taking off his clothes.</p>

			Laughter echoes, twice as bright,<br />
			In twin joy, hearts take flight.<br />
			Mirrored smiles, a shared life’s thread,<br />
			In each other, their spirits wed.

		<h1 id="ch4" class="chapter">Game</h1>
		<img src="images/signs/Vezis.svg" height="125" class="center"/>

		<p>The head of the class came up with an interesting game for the students: write a dictation,
			from the words of all its twelve participants. The idea was that, starting with the head,
			everyone in turn says a couple of sentences. In turn, all the students write down
			verbatim everything that the participants in the game announced. Participants who made
			a mistake or deliberately distorted the order or semantic meaning are removed from the game.
			Not all participants in the game are required to pronounce sentences, but those who wished to do so
			received a reward from the general fund in the form of game tickets. These tickets can be given away,
			sold, and spent in other ways at the discretion of the participants, like a game of Monopoly.
			It is important to note that each participant is required to announce all transactions
			with tickets out loud, in turn, those participants who voiced sentences were required
			to include in their narrative all the announced transactions with tickets.</p>

		<br /><i class="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be 90909 satoshis </i>

		<p>So the game continues, halving the reward with every twenty-first voiced sentence. And the sentences can be
			voiced no more than twelve times by every of students.</p>

		<p>Madara was aware of her attractiveness, youth and ability to wield her charm. By coincidence of
			life circumstances she was forced to allow strangers to enter her personal space. Dancing this tango of life
			had far-reaching consequences.

		<p>She had almost everything a woman could wish for: countless outfits, jewelry, subordinates,
			exquisite food and drink. But she did not love her husband, who gave her all the benefits,
			and she was absolutely dissatisfied with the lack of omnipotence over him.</p>

		<p>
			At another feast, she added death cap powder to his meal. It was loudy that day at Kismet street, where
			the celebration took place. She went to close the windows in the hall and meet the guests.
		</p>

		<p>
			The children burst into the hall and began to randomly change the plates standing nearby.
			They sometimes played waiters during family feasts.

			<i>"Why did you have to die!" he howled in dismay. "Couldn't I have gone instead of you!
			What am I going to do here alone, what am I going to do!... Oh, you were so good to me, so good...
			You loved me much more than my first love... Rest well, rest well... I'll come after you soon...
			I'll give you a big funeral... yes, I'll give you one..."

		<img src="images/signs/Cuskas_nesejs.svg" height="125" class="center"/>

		<p>A quiet and calm summer day turned into an expected storm. Antonio was watching thunders through the window.
			Suddenly, the ball lightning appeared. It was moving fast, extremely fast. From one point to another.
			A fascinating phenomenon.</p>

		<h1 id="ch10" class="chapter">Care</h1>
		<img src="images/signs/Strelnieks.svg" height="125" class="center"/>

		<p>Two plumbers, an old experienced one and a young trainee, arrive
			at the scene of an accident - to a sewer manhole, in it - up to a hatch of shit.
			The old one undresses without hesitation and dives in. Then he surfaces:
		</p>
		<p>
			<br />- Pliers!
			<br />(the young one hands it over). He dives again, surfaces:
			<br />- Plunger!
			<br />(the young one hands it over)...
			<br />- Monkey wrench!
		</p>
		<p>
		<img src="images/addresses/care.png" class="center"/>
					<br /><i class="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be 90909 satoshis </i>
		</p>
		<p>
			Some time passes, the old one fiddles around there, surfaces -
			the shit is gone. The accident is eliminated. He climbs to the surface,
			shakes himself off, and proudly says:
			- Learn, young one, or you'll be handing out tools all your life!
		</p>


		<h1 id="ch11" class="chapter">Solstice</h1>
		<img src="images/signs/Mezazis.svg" height="125" class="center"/>

		<p>
			As the light dwindled in the sky and the days grew shorter, the ancients wondered what was happening to the sun. Their shamans and storytellers supplied the answers.  Gods and goddesses were fighting for the survival of all life, playing games in the sky or battling each other for supremacy.
			Ancient peoples worked to be in balance with the forces of nature as they understood them.  Many cultures carefully watched the sun so that they would know when to plant, when to harvest and when to batten down the hatches for winter.
			What people do not know or understand, they make up stories to explain.
			What the ancients feared, they named so that they could understand it in some way.
			There are common patterns with Deities representing the sun or the light as the central theme.  At latitudes where the tilt of the earth causes the sun to dip very low, tales are told where the threat to the sun is mortal so the people must come forward in the sun's defense. Closer to the equator,  we will sometimes see the sun as simply losing interest or a diminishing of its capacity to perform its duty so the festivals and ceremonies are to remind of, or bind it to, its task.
			These days, most people think back on the mythical explanations that forces of nature were gods and goddesses as quaint legends. We know better.
